The Strategy Pattern 
It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

In the program,
FlyBehaviour and QuackBehaviour implementations represent the algorithms,
that may be changed in the classes extending the  Duck class at run time.
